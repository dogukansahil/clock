## Clock (Night clock via browser)
This is a simple web page that displays a digital clock. The clock shows the current time in hours and minutes, with the hours and minutes separated by a colon.
You don't need to install anything to use this clock, simply open it in your browser. The clock has a black background and uses a dark gray color for the time display, which makes it suitable for night use. Just open it in a tab and sleep. It's just 1kb.

# Installation
To use this clock on your own website, simply copy and paste the code in index.html into your HTML file. You'll also need to include the jQuery library, which you can do by adding the following line to your HTML file:

```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
```

# Usage
Once you've included the code and the jQuery library in your HTML file, the clock will automatically start running when the page is loaded. The clock will update every second to show the current time.
You can customize the appearance of the clock by editing the CSS in the head section of the HTML file.
